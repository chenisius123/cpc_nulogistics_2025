Description: CPC simulation code from NU Logistics project. 

This is our IEMS 394 (Client Project Challenge) repository containing the files to run the simulation. This project was completed by Selin Bennett, Alex Chen, Michael Edgar, and Pantira Ketkaew. This is not without the help of our amazing IEMS professors and to the client that supported us all the way, Reggie and Sindy. 

Please download all files and put them in the same directory or folder on your computer. This is a juypter notebook, so you will need a format to run jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files.
